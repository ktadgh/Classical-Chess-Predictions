# Classical Chess Predictions
Using logistic regression to predict the result of a chess game based on the players' ELOs and other factors
The regression model predicts wins, losses and draws, and overall can predict the expected points more accurately
than the ELO alone.
## Future work
Next, I want to use the pgn2data package and stockfish to analyze games and see how centipawn loss, number of blunders and 
other game data can predict the game winner, and assessing whether there are trends in performance metrics like these.
